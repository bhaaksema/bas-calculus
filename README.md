# m-G4ip, G3cp Haskell

Automated Theorem Prover for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic

Optimisations:
- m-G4ip switches to G3cp (classical logic) when the succedent is $\bot$.
- For the ($L\lor$) rule, the second premise uses information from the first (as proposed by Weich).
- For a proof rule with two premises, skips proving the second premise if it is identical to the first.

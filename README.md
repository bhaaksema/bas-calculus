# Haskell Sequent Calculus Theorem Prover

- Based on the sequent calculi m-G4ip (Int) and G3cp (Cl).
- m-G4ip switches to G3cp when the succedent is {$\bot$}.
- For the ($L\lor$) rule, the second premise uses information from the first (as proposed by Weich).
- Formulas are reduced with boolean simplification rules before any attempt to prove.

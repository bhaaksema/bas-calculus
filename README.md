# Prover for Superintuitionistic Logics in Haskell

## Installation
```bash
cabal install
```

## Usage
```bash
super LOGIC FILE

# e.g.

# Classical Propositional Logic
super cpl file.p

# Intuitionistic Propositional Logic
super ipl file.p

# Jankov's Propositional Logic
super jan file.p

# Jankov's Propositional Logic (as extension over IPL)
super "~p | ~~p" file.p

# GÃ¶del-Dummett Propositional Logic (as extension over IPL)
super "(p => q) | (q => p)" file.p
```

Some input file examples can be found in `test/problems`, 

## Features
- Based on a the rules of sequent calculi m-G4ip and intuitionistic tableau calculus.
- Once a variable $p$ or $\neg p$ is added to the antecedent, the sequent is substituted with $[\top/p]$ or $[\bot/p]$ respectively.
- Formulae are reduced with boolean simplification rules before proof attempt and during substitutions.
- Inference rules with propositional variables are omitted in favour of simplification and substitution rules.
- Formulae of the sequent are analyzed through naive focussing, some may be temporarily excluded to restrict backtracking.
